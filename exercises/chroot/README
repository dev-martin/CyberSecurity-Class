In this exercise, you will explore chroot jails.

Task 1:

   You will be creating a chroot jail in this task.  Take a look
   at the make_chroot.sh script.  If you run this, it creates a
   directory with a chroot jail environment.  You can then put your
   shell in the jail by going into the chroot directory, and running

      sudo chroot . /bin/sh

   Compare how this behaves to running the above command from
   somewhere outside of the chroot directory.

   You can exit the jail with the "exit" command.

Task 2:

   In this task, you will be learning how to break out of a chroot
   jail.  There's a file called unchroot.c and a Makefile.  The
   Makefile will build this file, and put it into the jail.  Take
   a look at what this does, and see if you can understand how it
   is breaking out of the jail.

   Can you make this work from the shell, rather than using the
   unchroot program?

Task 3:

   How can you make the jail stronger?  What else might you be able
   to add to it that might make it weaker (that is, would give you
   more options for escape)?
