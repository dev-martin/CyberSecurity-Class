In this assignment you will be working with a simple database to become
familiar with basic SQL statements.

1. Pull the lamp image from gizmonic (the VM should already have this):
     docker pull gizmonic.cs.umd.edu:8080/lamp

2. Start a container with this image, in interactive mode:
     docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt -ti gizmonic.cs.umd.edu:8080/lamp /bin/bash

3. Fix some weird permissions issues and launch the mysql server:
     chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql* && service mysql start

4. Start the MySQL console UI: "mysql -u root -p" (the password is "root")

5. Run "CREATE DATABASE mysqlsampledatabase;"

6. Run "USE mysqlsampledatabase;"

7. Run "SOURCE /mnt/mysqlsampledatabase.sql;" to import data

8. You can see all the databases on the VM by running "show databases;"

9. See all the tables by running "show tables;"

10. See detailed information about a table: "describe customers;"

11. Find SELECT queries to get the following information from the
    customers table (use online documentation like W3Schools or the
    file sql_quick_ref in this repo):
    - Find the phone number for "Mini Wheels Co." 
    - Get all the customers in France
    - Get the names and credit limits of all the customers and sort in
      ascending order
    - Get the names of all cities where more than one customer lives

    Store these queries in a file named queries.sql
