You have been given a binary named target. We are not telling you
what this does, nor what arguments it takes. Your task is to get
this program to generate an Illegal Instruction. That is, your input
should cause the program to attempt to execute something that is
within the program's address space, but that is not a valid x86_64
opcode.

Your command-line arguments should be in a file named args. We will
invoke the program as

    ./target $(cat args)

Since the program's behavior might not be deterministic, due to
ASLR, we will run it 30 times with your arguments. Only one of those
runs needs to produce an error, but you should be able to generate
an Illegal Instruction with reasonably high probability.
