Spam and malware distribution is an international business. This
exercise asks you to determine where the following domains are
physically hosted.  Note that, for purposes of stable responses,
these are not malicious domains, but were chosen to illustrate the
international nature of online services.

Your response to this exercise will be in the file "locations".

For each of the following domains, provide the country in which the
corresponding server is located. This should be in the following
format:
  
<domain> <country>

<explanation of how you determined this>

For example:

www.google.com United States of America

I determined this by consulting the oracles, who gathered at midnight
under a full moon to tell me that this is where this domain is
hosted.


The country must be provided in the form used on the page
http://www.un.org/en/member-states/

The domains to identify are:
