You have been given a simple HTTP server in server.py. This supports
two skins: light and dark. The former prints black text on a white
background, while the latter prints white text on a black background.

For this exercise, you must produce the following:

  * A bash script named server.sh that starts the server
  * A bash script named client.sh that runs your client, including
    any compilation not done by the Makefile

Your client should use this server to obtain the contents of the file
/var/secret/token. It should then print this, and *only* this, to the
terminal before exiting.
